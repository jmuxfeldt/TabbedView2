related:: Classes/TabbedView2,Classes/CompositeView, Classes/ScrollView

DESCRIPTION::
WARNING::
You never instantiate a TabbedViewTab directly, but rather use TabbedView2.add to add it to the parent view and get a reference to the tab. However, once you have the reference, you can use it like a CompositeView or a ScrollView, plus you can configure all kinds of options, and override TabbedView2 defaults.
